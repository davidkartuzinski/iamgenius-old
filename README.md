This project, hosted at https://iamgenius.io, uses Next.js to highlight the "24 Characteristics that Geniuses have in Common" as written by Doctor Barrios.

I have had to learn how to do various functions in this app. The following people wrote excellent posts or tutorials or instruction on the following subjects:

1. Creating a multilanguage app in Next.js 13, using the new App directory and using .js (as opposed to .ts).

- [Adriano Raiano](https://github.com/adrai) and [Jan MÃ¼hlemann](https://github.com/jamuhl) in their excellent tutorial on [how to translate a Next.js app](https://locize.com/blog/next-13-app-dir-i18n/). And a fully functioning repo [GitHub](https://github.com/i18next/next-13-app-dir-i18next-example/tree/main) The [i18next docs](https://www.i18next.com/) are really helpful as well.

2. How to properly import SVG images and some options to the excellent next/images import.

- [Joseph Mawa](https://github.com/nibble0101) wrote this [primer on next/images with SVGs on LogRocket](https://blog.logrocket.com/import-svgs-next-js-apps/).
